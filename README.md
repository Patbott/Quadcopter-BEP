# Quadcopter-BEP
This repository contains the MATLAB Simulink models to run the quadcopter simulation and the performance data of the 3DR Pixhawk Autopilot
of the research paper 'Comparison and implementation of Kalman Filter Designs for a Real-Time Quadcopter System'.

# Simulations
The Simulation folder contains a m-script 'Main', running this scripts runs the different simulations of the estimator and plots the figures
found in the research paper.

# Implementation
This folder contains the logging data of the 3DR Pixhawk Autopilot and an m-script called 'plotting' to plot the calculation time figure as 
found in the research paper.
